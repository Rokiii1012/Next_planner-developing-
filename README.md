# Next-Planner


This project is built based on ROS2. Based on the differential flat  characteristics of the kinematics model of  vehicle-like robot, the  finite-state machine is used as the decision-making framework, and A*,  minimum jerk and collision avoidance algorithms are integrated to  realize motion planning in a known environment.

## 5. Updates

Now the front-end and back-end algorithms have been completed, and the  front-end has been embedded in the finite-state machine decision  framework. Subsequently, collision avoidance algorithms and constraints  of car-like robots will be introduced.
